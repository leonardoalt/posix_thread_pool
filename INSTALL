Installation Instructions
=========================

The simplest way to compile the library is:

  1. Type `make' to compile the library.

  2. Type `make install' to install the library. You need root power to do it.

  3. Type `make test' to generate an executable to test the library ( necessary for developers =] ).
     A file named ./ptp will be created. If you didn't install the library, you will need to type
     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`
     to execute ./ptp.

  4. If you want to generate the documentation, type `doxygen doxygen.cfg', and a folder name doc will be created with the documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.
