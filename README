POSIX Thread Pool
=========

POSIX Thread Pool (PTP) is a POSIX-based implementation of a thread pool.

With PTP you are to:
- Create a thread pool (thread safe) with min and max number of threads;
- Chose the timeout that makes an idle extra thread to die;
- Implement your function to decide when a new thread will be created;
- Add as many tasks as you want (need);

TODO:
- Separate ACTIVE and QUEUED tasks (need it?);
- Pool (threads) WAIT and DESTROY (stop);
- Pool reset (need it?);
- Policies to schedule the threads into the pool (lifo, fifo, piority, etc);
